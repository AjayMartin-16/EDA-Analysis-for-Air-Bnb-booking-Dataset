# **Project Summary -**

This project aimed to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing approximately 49,000 Airbnb listings in New York City from 2019. The dataset comprised 16 variables, including listing details like price, location, room type, host information, and guest reviews. The primary goal was to identify key trends and insights to help Airbnb optimize its pricing, property distribution, and marketing strategies, ultimately driving more bookings and enhancing customer satisfaction.

The analysis began by handling missing data, particularly in the `reviews_per_month` and `last_review` columns. Missing values for reviews per month were filled with zeros, assuming that listings without reviews had not been reviewed yet. Additionally, we removed rows with missing last review dates to avoid bias in the review-related analysis. Outlier filtering was also performed, especially for extreme price values, to ensure that the analysis focused on the majority of listings, making the insights more applicable for business decisions.

Various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations were employed to uncover trends. For instance, a count plot of room types revealed that most listings were for entire homes or private rooms, highlighting travelers’ preference for privacy. Meanwhile, the price distribution showed that a significant portion of listings were priced under $200 per night, indicating Airbnb’s strong presence in the budget and mid-tier accommodation market. Another key finding was that reviews were more frequent for private rooms than entire homes, suggesting higher guest turnover for cheaper accommodations. Geographical analysis revealed that the bulk of listings were concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with fewer options in Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. This geographic imbalance presents growth opportunities in less saturated boroughs, especially for budget-conscious travelers.

Further analysis of pricing trends showed that Manhattan listings command the highest prices, while Staten Island offers the most affordable options. Airbnb can leverage this by promoting affordable alternatives in areas like Queens and Staten Island, thus attracting more budget travelers and relieving pressure on high-demand areas like Manhattan. The analysis of reviews per month showed that private rooms in Brooklyn and Queens had higher guest engagement compared to Manhattan, suggesting these areas could benefit from increased attention in terms of marketing and promotion.

Multivariate analysis using a pairplot and a correlation heatmap revealed weak correlations between key metrics such as price, number of reviews, and availability. This indicates that pricing and performance are influenced by multiple factors, making simple pricing strategies ineffective. Instead, Airbnb can benefit from a dynamic, AI-driven pricing system that considers various factors to set optimal prices in real-time, improving occupancy rates while maximizing revenue.

In summary, the project provides actionable insights for Airbnb to refine its business strategy. First, implementing dynamic pricing based on real-time factors can help optimize listings and increase booking frequency. Second, marketing efforts should focus on promoting underserved areas like Queens and Bronx to balance demand across the city and attract more travelers seeking affordable accommodations. Third, encouraging hosts to offer flexible minimum stays and improve guest experiences can help boost reviews and overall engagement. Lastly, promoting high-demand listings, particularly in Brooklyn and Manhattan, can help sustain occupancy and revenue growth. These data-driven recommendations will enable Airbnb to enhance both customer satisfaction and profitability, driving sustained business growth in New York City.

The dataset is related to Airbnb listings in New York City (2019) and contains 49,000 observations with 16 columns. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables, providing insights into various aspects of Airbnb properties, hosts, and guest interactions.

What the Data Tells:
* Geographical Distribution: The dataset provides information on the geographical distribution of listings across the five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island.
* Room Types: The listings cover a range of room types, from entire homes/apartments to private/shared rooms and hotel rooms, indicating diversity in the kinds of stays Airbnb offers.
* Price and Availability: Listings vary significantly in price, which can be analyzed to understand market trends and customer affordability. Some listings have full-year availability, while others are booked for only part of the year.
* Host Activity: The dataset contains metrics that reflect host engagement (number of reviews, reviews per month, calculated host listings count), which can be used to evaluate host performance and the frequency of guest interactions.
* Guest Engagement: Reviews per month and number of reviews give an indication of how often a listing is booked and how guests interact with it, helping to assess popularity and customer satisfaction.
